    <h1>Madara and Obito's dialogue</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Wake up to reality! Nothing ever goes as planned in this accursed world.</li>
        <li>whats wrong with this old man?</li>
        <li>The longer you live the more you will realize that the only things that exist in this reality are merely pain, suffering and futility.</li>
        <li>Listen. Everywhere you look in this world, wherever there is light there will always be shadows to be found as well.</li>
        <li>As long as there is a concept of victors the vanquished will also exist.</li>
        <li>The selfish intent of wanting to preserve peace imitates wars. And hatred is born in order to protect love. There are nexuses, casual<br>
             relationships that cannot be separated normally.</li>
    </ul>
